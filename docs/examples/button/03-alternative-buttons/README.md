Generally, only the {% code inline="true" language="html" code="<button/>" /%}
element should be used for actions. In some cases though, what seems like an
action to the user is actually a navigation in the app or a general click.
Use the {% code inline="true" language="css" code=".br-button" /%}
class on non-button elements to give them a button appearance.
